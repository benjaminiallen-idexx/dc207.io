Our first meeting will take place on November 8th, 2018. We'll have a 20 minute talk about open source intellegence titled: "OSINT - What we already know". We'll explore open source intellegence and how effective it can be in gain access to resources. You'll learn what you need to do to profile yourself, and your own company. 

We'll also take a little time to talk though the solution of the CTF challenge posted below. We'll talk about how we want to run our meetings, CTF challenges, and have a drink or two afterwards. So please, come, we want you! (to break stuff)
